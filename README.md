# Encryptum MCP

MCP is a protocol layer designed to manage, secure, and verify context-specific data interactions in decentralized environments. A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows LLM to interact with the blockchain through Encryptum.

Encryptum use metamask tools, your private keys remain securely stored in your crypto wallet and are never shared with the AI agent when signing messages or sending transactions.

The **Model Context Protocol** is designed to:
- Enable **context binding** for AI agents and LLMs
- Store **verifiable, encrypted data** on decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS)
- Allow **access control and provenance** tracking via smart contracts
- Power next-gen applications in AI, legal, finance, health, and beyond
